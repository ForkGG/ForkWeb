## Getting started
The documentation is basically a bunch of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) files to make editing them as easy as possible. Some code-magic makes them a little more stylish to look and feel like it does.

If you want to contribute you can either select a topic from our list of sites which still need to be done, or if you have your own idea be sure to let us know, so we can add it to our list. A detailed description of how to contribute to the documentation can be found in the Discord channel `doc-101` and if you need some help just ask us in `doc-talk`.

Active contributors will get a dedicated Discord role, so everyone can see their awesomness, as well as being mentioned in the following section.
