## Mod support
Currently there is no "of-the-shelf" mod support in Fork, like there is for plugins. 

The adviced way to go is to install Forge (or any other modded client) by hand by replacing the `server.jar` in your server folder. After that you can manually add mods by adding them to the `mods` folder inside your server folder.

For more informations about installing a custom `server.jar` see: [Custom server.jar](#Custom-server-jar).
