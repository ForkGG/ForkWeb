## Your First Server
So, you have installed Fork and you want to start making servers to play with your friends, are you ready to learn how?

When we open Fork for the first time and we haven&apos;t made a server yet, we get a screen with 2 options. For now we&apos;re gonna teach you how to create a server. Let's click on the "Create a Server" button shown bellow.

After clicking it, we are prompet up with a lot of options. Don&apos;t panic! We explain in a further Doc how to config your server. For now let&apos;s see how we can get our server up and running.

We have different options of server:

:::table-div
| Server     | Description |
| :--------- | :-----:|
| Vanilla  | The true classic minecraft server experience |
| Paper    | Plugin modified minecraft with better performance |
| Waterfall     | Network System for Minecraft Servers (Bungee) |
:::

We can choose whatever server type we want in terms of what we need, in this case, we're gonna stick with Vanilla to show how it works out the box.

As per the version, we can also choose it freely. The rest of the config will be looked in another Doc ahead.

Now that we&apos;re done, let&apos;s hit the green anvil button ![](https://i.imgur.com/cyJgEsP.png) to finish making the server. 

_And voil√†!_ We&apos;ve finished our server and hitted start and it&apos;s running. Good Job!
