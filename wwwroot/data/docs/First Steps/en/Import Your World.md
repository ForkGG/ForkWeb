## Importing your World

Wait, you don&apos;t want a new world? If that&apos;s your case, you&apos;re in the right section. Let&apos;s start.

First, let&apos;s do it in the ``Create a server`` section.
When we start creating a server, we just scroll down till we find at the bottom the ``Misc`` section and we click on _Click to select your World_

When we do this, we will be prompted with your prefered file-manager and be asked to select a world. **Remember** it&apos;s important that you select the folder itself, not something inside.

When we have done it, it should look something like this:

>_**But wait**_ what if i want to do it with a server that&apos;s already created?

First, let&apos;s shutdown ther server and go into the settings, and select the "globe" icon.

Here we can import the world the same way we&apos;ve explained before. Just select a folder and import it, and it&apos;s done!

>Further note: If you have a server with multiple worlds (in the case for example of a multiverse Paper server) you can change individually each world created with the world list.
