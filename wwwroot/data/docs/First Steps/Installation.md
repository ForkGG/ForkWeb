After this you will be prompted to download ``ForkLauncher.exe``
Save it and put it in a location you have easy access and launch it to start using Fork.

When you first execute it, fork will be installed in ``%appdata%/Fork`` , and you will be prompted to make (or import) your first server.


## Others
As of now, Fork can **only run on Windows** but we&apos;re also working on solutions to bring Fork to Mac and Linux.
